Nutrition and Meal Tracking App: MealMaster

Tech Stack: JavaScript, React, Node.js, MongoDB.

Core Features:

Recipe Creation and Sharing: Users can create, save, and share recipes. Each recipe displays detailed nutritional information, including calories, protein, carbs, and fats per serving.

Weekly Meal Planning: Users can plan their weekly meals by selecting from recipes, snacks, or individual ingredients, creating a personalized meal plan.

Saving Meal Plans: Users can save their full meal plans for future use, allowing for easy access and reuse of successful meal plans.

Automated Grocery List Generation: Based on the meal plan, the app automatically generates a grocery list, which can be saved and accessed separately.

Enhanced Features:

Portion Adjustment and Macro Recalculation: This feature allows users to adjust the portion sizes of recipes. The app recalculates and updates the macro-nutritional values (like protein, carbs, fats) based on the new serving size.

Protein-Based Recipe Search: Users can search for recipes by specifying their protein requirements (e.g., recipes with approximately 40 grams of protein). The app filters and presents recipes that meet these nutritional criteria.
